I started out with the Lagrange Interpolation Method, and it did give me the results but I was skeptical regarding it. So next I tried the Matrix Method and it gave me the same results as the Lagrange Interpolation Method. So I was confident that the results were correct. I also tried the Gauss Elimination Method, just for the sake of it, but since that too gave me the same results, so I went ahead and added all three to the final codebase. I tried verifying it through online Lagrange calculators and they provided the same response for the first test case, but for the second one it was a negative value. This is where I got confused, as the problem statement clearly mentioned that the result should be a positive integer. So I went ahead and tried the Matrix Method and the Gauss Elimination Method, and they both provided the same results as the Lagrange Interpolation Method. So thats why I added all three methods to the final codebase. The second test case had very large value, and it proved very tough to compute it manually, hence the confusion regarding the result. Either its what all the methods provided: 79836264049851 or 4.39027E20.
